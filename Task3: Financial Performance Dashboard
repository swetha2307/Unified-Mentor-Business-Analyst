# Financial Performance Dashboard - Tableau Implementation Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for implementing the Financial Performance Dashboard in Tableau.

## 1. Data Connection

1. Open Tableau Desktop
2. Click on "Connect to Data" and select the appropriate file type (Excel/CSV)
3. Navigate to the downloaded dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PGTp4teuL7jArkWCw-dd2YiZ6BZtlUMw/view)
4. In the Data Source tab:
   - Verify that date fields are correctly recognized
   - Ensure numeric fields are measures
   - Confirm text fields are dimensions

## 2. Creating Calculated Fields

Create the following calculated fields to enhance your analysis:

### Basic Calculations

```
Profit Margin = IF SUM([Sales]) != 0 THEN SUM([Profit]) / SUM([Sales]) END

Total Revenue = SUM([Gross Sales])

COGS to Sales = IF SUM([Sales]) != 0 THEN SUM([COGS]) / SUM([Sales]) END

Discount Impact = SUM([Discounts]) / SUM([Gross Sales])

GP Margin = IF SUM([Gross Sales]) != 0 THEN SUM([Profit]) / SUM([Gross Sales]) * 100 END

NP Margin = IF SUM([Sales]) != 0 THEN SUM([Profit]) / SUM([Sales]) * 100 END
```

### Advanced Calculations

```
YoY Growth = (SUM([Sales]) - LOOKUP(SUM([Sales]), -1)) / LOOKUP(SUM([Sales]), -1)

Running Total Sales = RUNNING_SUM(SUM([Sales]))

Profit per Unit = SUM([Profit])/SUM([Units Sold])

EBITDA = SUM([Profit]) + [Operating Expenses]  // Assuming you have or can calculate Operating Expenses
```

## 3. Building Core Visualizations

### Visualization 1: Sales and Profit by Country

1. Create a new worksheet
2. Drag "Country" to Rows
3. Drag "Sales" to Columns
4. Add "Profit" to Color on the Marks card
5. Sort by Sales (descending)
6. Edit the tooltip to show:
   - Country
   - Sales
   - Profit
   - Profit Margin
   - COGS

### Visualization 2: Sales and Profit Trend

1. Create a new worksheet
2. Drag "Date" (or Year + Month) to Columns
3. Right-click on the Date pill and select "Month" or appropriate time granularity
4. Drag "Sales" and "Profit" to Rows
5. Change the mark type to "Line"
6. Add "Segment" to Color for multi-segment analysis

### Visualization 3: Gross Sales vs Discounts Scatter Plot

1. Create a new worksheet
2. Drag "Gross Sales" to Columns
3. Drag "Discounts" to Rows
4. Change the mark type to "Circle"
5. Add "Product" or "Country" to Color
6. Add "Profit" to Size
7. Add reference lines for average Gross Sales and average Discounts

### Visualization 4: Product Performance Heat Map

1. Create a new worksheet
2. Drag "Product" to Rows
3. Drag "Discount Band" to Columns
4. Drag "Sales" to Color
5. Edit color scheme to use a sequential palette (e.g., white to blue)
6. Sort Products by total Sales

### Visualization 5: Profit and Loss Statement

1. Create a new worksheet
2. Set up a text table with hierarchical financial metrics
3. Include calculated fields for:
   - Gross Profit
   - Operating Profit
   - EBITDA
   - Net Profit
4. Format numbers as currency
5. Use conditional formatting to highlight positive/negative values

## 4. Dashboard Assembly

1. Create a new dashboard with an appropriate size (recommend 1200 x 800 pixels)
2. Add a dashboard title: "Financial Performance Dashboard"
3. Create a layout with:
   - KPI cards at the top
   - Main visualizations in the center
   - Filters and legends on the right side

4. Add filters:
   - Date/Year filter (top left)
   - Segment filter (below Date)
   - Country filter (below Segment)
   - Product filter (optional)

5. Enable cross-filtering:
   - Right-click on visualizations and select "Use as Filter"
   - Set up appropriate dashboard actions

6. Add a "Reset All" button:
   - Create a calculated field "Reset" with the value TRUE
   - Add this field as a filter and show the filter
   - Edit the filter title to "Reset All"

## 5. Formatting and Polish

1. Establish a consistent color scheme:
   - Blue for Sales
   - Green for Profit
   - Red for negative values
   - Grey for neutral elements

2. Format all currency values consistently:
   - Use thousands separators
   - Show appropriate decimal places

3. Add informative titles to all visualizations

4. Create comprehensive tooltips that provide context

5. Add annotations to highlight key insights or outliers

## 6. Sharing and Publishing

1. Save your Tableau workbook (.twb or .twbx)
2. Publish to Tableau Public, Tableau Server, or Tableau Online as appropriate
3. Set up scheduled refreshes if connecting to live data
4. Create a PDF export for stakeholders who don't have Tableau

## 7. Documentation

Create documentation that includes:
- Data dictionary
- Calculation explanations
- Guide for interpreting key visualizations
- Instructions for using dashboard filters

This implementation guide covers all necessary steps to recreate and customize the Financial Performance Dashboard in Tableau.
