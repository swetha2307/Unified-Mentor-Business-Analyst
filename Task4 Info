# Supply Chain Management Dashboard

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a comprehensive Supply Chain Management Dashboard built using Tableau. The dashboard analyzes and visualizes key metrics related to fashion and beauty makeup products throughout the supply chain, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information on makeup products' supply chain, featuring:
- Product information (Type, SKU, Price)
- Sales metrics (Availability, Products sold, Revenue)
- Customer demographics
- Inventory data (Stock levels, Lead times)
- Order information (Quantities, Shipping times, Costs)
- Supplier details (Name, Location, Lead time)
- Manufacturing metrics (Production volumes, Lead time, Costs)
- Quality control (Inspection results, Defect rates)
- Transportation data (Modes, Routes, Costs)

## Dashboard Components

### 1. Executive Summary
- KPI cards showing total revenue, on-time delivery rate, average lead time, and total supply chain costs
- Trend analysis of key performance indicators over time

### 2. Inventory Management
- Current inventory levels by product type and warehouse
- Inventory trends over time
- Days of inventory remaining calculation
- Stock level alerts for products approaching reorder point

### 3. Order Fulfillment
- Order fulfillment status trends
- On-time delivery rates by product category
- Order volume and fulfillment rate by region
- Customer satisfaction metrics

### 4. Supplier Performance
- Supplier delivery time comparison
- Defect rates by supplier
- Cost efficiency analysis
- Supplier reliability scores

### 5. Transportation Efficiency
- Transit times by carrier and delivery status
- Delivery status trends
- Shipping cost analysis by route and carrier
- Transportation mode efficiency comparison

### 6. Supply Chain Costs
- Cost distribution by type (pie chart)
- Cost trends over time
- Cost breakdown by product category
- Cost optimization opportunities

## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites
- Tableau Desktop (2022.1 or later recommended)
- SQL knowledge for data preparation (optional)
- Microsoft Excel for data preprocessing

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Download the dataset from the provided link
3. Data preparation:
   - Clean the dataset using the provided preprocessing scripts
   - Create the necessary calculated fields in Tableau
4. Open the Tableau workbook file (`supply_chain_dashboard.twbx`)
5. Connect to your prepared dataset
6. Customize the dashboard parameters as needed

### Tableau Calculated Fields
```
// Inventory Management Calculations
Days of Inventory Remaining: [InventoryLevel] / AVG([DailySales])
Inventory Status: IF [Days of Inventory Remaining] < 7 THEN "Critical" 
                  ELSEIF [Days of Inventory Remaining] < 14 THEN "Low" 
                  ELSEIF [Days of Inventory Remaining] < 30 THEN "Adequate" 
                  ELSE "Excess" END

// Order Fulfillment Calculations
On-Time Delivery Rate: SUM(IF [OnTimeDelivery] = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT([OrderID])
Average Fulfillment Time: DATEDIFF('day', [OrderDate], [DeliveryDate])

// Supplier Performance Calculations
Average Delivery Time: AVG([DeliveryTime])
Defect Rate: SUM([DefectiveUnits]) / SUM([TotalUnits])
Supplier Score: (10 - [Average Delivery Time]/2) - ([Defect Rate] * 10)

// Transportation Efficiency Calculations
Average Transit Time: AVG([TransitTime])
Carrier Efficiency: SUM(IF [DeliveryStatus] = 'On Time' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT([ShipmentID])

// Supply Chain Costs Calculations
Total Costs: SUM([Amount])
Cost per Unit: SUM([Amount]) / SUM([Units])
```
