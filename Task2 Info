Volatility Analysis

Netflix exhibited the highest volatility among the four stocks, with frequent price swings
Apple showed moderate volatility with occasional significant price movements
Google demonstrated the lowest volatility with the most stable price action
Volatility typically increased for all stocks following major market announcements or earnings reports

Correlation Patterns

Google and Microsoft showed strong positive correlation (0.78) in their price movements
Apple and Google exhibited moderate positive correlation (0.62)
Netflix had the weakest correlation with other stocks, suggesting more independent price movement
Correlations strengthened during broader market downturns, indicating increased systemic risk during stress periods

Volume-Price Relationship

Significant price changes were often preceded by unusual trading volumes
Apple showed the most consistent volume-price relationship, with volume spikes typically preceding price movements by 1-2 days
Netflix demonstrated the strongest volume-price impact, with price changes often proportional to abnormal trading volumes
Pre-earnings trading volumes were elevated for all stocks, with post-earnings volumes highest for stocks that surprised market expectations

Moving Average Insights

Several potential trading signals were identified through moving average crossovers
The 7-day and 30-day moving average crossovers provided the most reliable signals
Microsoft showed the clearest bullish signals with upward crossovers
Netflix exhibited potential reversal signals toward the end of the period
Moving averages effectively smoothed out market noise, especially for Google and Apple
